#Introduction To Programming

The computer will do what you tell it to do.

##What is a Program

* A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do
* __Programming__ is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.
* It isn't about the programming language. It is about changing how you think.
* We have to know how the computer thinks to change how we think.
* The short answer is that they don’t think.
* The slightly longer answer is that while computers don’t think, they act as if they do, by sequentially executing simple instructions.
* The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it.

##Pseudo Code

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language. Instead, use english.

Note:
We will talk about algorithms later.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,

```
If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door
```

This semester we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a program…

##Thermostat

* Together, let's write pseudo-code that describes how a thermometer works to maintain the temperature of a room.

##Rock Paper Scissors

* In a group, write pseudo-code that describes one game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

#What Is JavaScript

Javascript is a browser-side scripting language. Let's look at some example code and translate our pseudo-code in JS.

##Reading JS - Color Switcher

* Let's look at a solution file together and read JS for the first time.

##Traffic Light

* Let's go to this Codepen and look at this broken project together - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EPXqEW
